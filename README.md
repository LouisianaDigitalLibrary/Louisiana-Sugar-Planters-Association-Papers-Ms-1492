## About the archival collection
Summary: The Louisiana Sugar Planters' Association was founded in 1877 by a group of prominent planters. Based in New Orleans, the group was largely responsible for setting in motion the modernization of Louisiana's sugar industry. It merged with the American Cane Growers' Association in 1922, creating the American Sugar Cane League. Correspondence is primarily addressed to Reginald Dykers, secretary of the Louisiana Sugar Plantersâ€™ Association. Letters pertain to topics of discussion at meetings; statistics on cane growing; new cane cutting machines; Spanish, Italian, and German immigrants working in Louisiana as plantation laborers and supervisors; and funding needed for a molasses refining test.
